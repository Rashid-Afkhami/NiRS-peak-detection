# NiRS-peak-detection

Near-infrared spectroscopy can be used to assess cerebrovascular health. NiRS signals are filtered and averaged resulting in a signle-beat signal called the arterial pulsation signal. The arterial pulsation signal shows the blood volume change in a single cardiac cycle. The systolic, diastolic and reflected peak in the arterial pulsation signal can be used to determine vascular elasticity. The code here is a peak detection algorithm for NiRS arterial pulsation signals.
